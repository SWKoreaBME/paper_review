# Deep Visual Domain Adaptation: A Survey

( Wang et al., Neurocomputing 2018, IF=4.072, 2018, 28/134 Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence)



## Abstract

1. Deep Domain adaptation has emerged - New Learning Tech to address the Lack of massive amounts of labeled data
2. Differences with Conventional Methods
   1. Conventional
      - Learn shared feature subspaces
      - Reuse important source instances with shallow representations
   2. Deep Domain Adaptation
      - Leverage deep networks to learn more transferable representations by embedding DA in the pipeline of DL
3. The Four-fold contributions of this Survey
   1. Present a taxonomy of different DDA scenarios according to the properties of data
   2. Summarize DDA into several categories based on training loss, and analyze and compare the SOTA methods
   3. Overview CV applications ( image classification, face recognition, semantic segmentation, object detection )
   4. Some potential deficiencies of current methods and several future directions
