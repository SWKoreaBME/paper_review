# A Survey of Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery

by Maithra Raghu, Eric Schmidt @ Google

> In this survey, we focus on addressing this central issue, **providing an overview of many widely used deep learning models, spanning visual, sequential and graph structured data, associated tasks and different training methods, along with techniques to use deep learning with less data and better interpret these complex models** â€” two central considerations for many scientific use cases
>
> We also **include overviews of the full design process**, implementation tips, and links to a plethora of tutorials, research summaries and open-sourced deep learning pipelines and pretrained models, developed by the community
