Probabilistic Hierarchical Segmentation : PHiSeg

### Abstract

- we propose a novel method to model **the conditional probability distribution** of the segmentations given an input image.
- We derive a **hierarchical probabilistic model**, in which **separate latent variables are responsible for modelling the segmentation at different resolutions**.
-  Inference in this model can be efficiently performed using the variational autoencoder framework
- Proposed model can be used to generate significantly **more realistic and diverse segmentation samples** compared to recent related work, both, **when trained with annotations from a single or multiple annotators**
