#### 3. MRI Super-Resolution with Ensemble Learning and Complementary Priors ( Qing Lyu et al., 2019 )

- Obtaining high-quality MR image is often challenging
- Ensemble learning and DL framework for MR image Super Resolution
  - First **enlarged low resolution images** using 5 commonly used super-resolution algs and obtained differentiallly enlarged image datasets with complementary priors
  - Then, GAN is trained with each dataset to generate super-resolution MR images
  - Finally, **CNN is used for ensemble learning** that synergies **the outputs of GAN**s into the final MR SR images.
  - According to results, the ensemble learning results outcome any one of GAN outputs

- **Single Image Super resolution (SISR)**
- 3D Densely Connected Super Resolution Network ( DCSRN )

- **Single Image Super resolution (SISR) on 3D images**

- GAN framework and developed a generator coupled w/ discriminator to tackle the task of 3D SISR on T1 brain MRI images

- Developed a **3D memory-efficient residual-dense block generator ( MRDG )** that achieves SOTA performance in terms of PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE ( normalized MSE Error )

#### 7. Image super-resolution using progressive generative adversarial networks for medical image analysis  ( Dwarikanath Mahaptra et al., 2018, Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics )

- Proposed an image super-resolution method using progressive GAN ( P - GANs ) which takes an input a low resolution image and **generate a high resolution image of desired scaling factor**
- Primary Contribution : proposing **a multi-stage model** where the **output image quality of one stage** is **progressively improved in the next stage** by **using a triplet loss function**
- **Triplet loss** enables **stepwise image quality improvement** by **using the output of the previous stage as the baseline**
- Results show that this multi-stage **P-GAN outperforms competing methods and baseline GANs**.
